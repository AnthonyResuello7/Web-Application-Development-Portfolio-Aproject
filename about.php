                    Welcome to AProject, the online platform designed to
                    help Aston computing students manage their software
                    projects!. We strive to develop a web-based platform
                    that is user-friendly and powered by a database, to
                    facilitate the registration, login, and project
                    uploading process for Aston computing students

                    Once a student adds a project to our platform, it
                    becomes publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view
                    and search for projects on our website. This feature
                    allows students to exhibit their work, exchange
                    thoughts with others, and receive constructive
                    feedback.
